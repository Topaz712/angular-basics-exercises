# AngularBasicsExercises

## Reflecting on my progress:

- Integrating multiple components into a single angular app felt a little like when you're inside of a mirror maze at the county fair in a way, I did feel like after watching Max's videos I overcomplicated the first exercise
because as i pictured how I would start to create the class and for profile, I ended up forgetting when i imported the components I created, so to make it easier I generated the new component instead and then remembered I
liked the way Max showed how to add a class model to a component so I went down that route for that exercise

- I realize that some problems are easier than they sound in my mind.. for the counter exercise , we needed to create a simple counter and I always try to add a for loop to the increments but I remember to take a step back and see
  the easier ,less code way to solve the problem

  I did enjoy using Angular though, the way the code is organized in its own designated files/folders/components is pretty cool even if it is a little confusing to navigate at first
